# Creating a simple to do list using python 
### Hey there, everyone! I'm Gaafer Astroinforamatics specialist & python devolper , Through this talk We are going to dive into areally cool coding project.
### We'll establish a simple `To-Do List` application using python. This program allows you to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as done, and exit the list. It’s a great way to keep track of your tasks and stay organized 
 First,We begin by defining a function called main(). This function will be the heart of our `To-Do List` program.
 Inside the function, we create an empty list called tasks. This list will hold all our tasks.
 We use a while True loop to keep the program running until the user decides to exit. Inside the loop, we display a menu with four options:

- Add Task
- Show Tasks
- Mark Task as Done
- Exit

 The user is prompted to enter their choice.
 If the user selects `option ‘1’`, they can add tasks to their `To-Do List`.
The program asks how many tasks the user wants to add.
Then, for each task, the user enters a description, and we add that task to our tasks list along with a status of “Not Done.”
If the user chooses `option ‘2’`, we display the list of tasks along with their statuses.
We use a loop to go through each task and show its number, description, and whether it’s done or not.
Now, if the user picks `option ‘3’`, they can mark a task as done. They enter the task number they want to mark, and if the number is valid, we change the status of that task to `“Done.”`
 Finally, if the user goes with `option ‘4’`, we exit the To-Do List by breaking out of the loop.
